        Looking For

          I've been avoiding java because I wanted to work in the same language as my pet projects. But now I want to take
          my professional side on a stable path which is java. In the long run I feel java will be a better investment
          for me but will continue to playing around with other languages. I am looking for a junior java web developer position
          but it's worth noting that most of my web knowledge is with dynamically typed language of which I believe I
          am pretty solid with. I used java for assigments in varsity and have recently been checking it out and comparing it 
          to Ruby and Laravel and for the most part they kind of work the same way.

          I have been building a social network which has transformed to a LMS over time for the last 6 years and it started out with 
          PHP for 4 years before moving to Ruby on Rails. Now I am in the process of rebuilding it with Elixir's Phoenix Framework.
          The Ruby version uses Rails, Postgresql, Elastic Search, Memcached and was hosted on Amazon AWS. I am now rebuilding it
          with Elixir which is a sorta "functional" programming language.

          I keep testing new technologies because I would like to build systems that are:

            cost effective
          %li.summary__list_item
            easy to maintain
          %li.summary__list_item
            easy to pass on to other developers with little explanation
          %li.summary__list_item
            scalable if ever needed
          %li.summary__list_item
            efficient enought to boost user experience

          I would also like to see myself reach the highest levels a within the next five to ten years and would be happy to discuss the levels I have reached so far.

        Passion For Web
      .section__content
        %p.summary__paragraph
          Passionate about web development and spent the last 6 years learning as much as I can. I like to watch conference videos posted by the likes of Google, AirBnB, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and many software engineering companies. I also like to read their articles and the challenges they face and how they solve them. I am reading a few books on how to write cleaner maintanable code which has nothing to do with syntax.

        %p.summary__paragraph
          I like solving backend problems using Ruby, PHP and Nodejs but don't really care too much about what I use. Being into ruby, it's only natural that I use Mac, Tmux, Vim and Linux for deployment. I know how to automate things using both Ruby and Nodejs and know my way around Gulp and Webpack. I am an introvert but that changes when talking about web development in general.

            I doubt I would have learned much in the long run if I had continued to do the most basic things.

          -#   compare myself with other developers from different companies and I realised that I am way ahead of what my title makes me.
          .work__opinion
            It is still a work in progress but I have been trusted enough to write code for things that are out of the scope of a junior.
            I make this assumption based on junior developer tests I've seen which basically test if the person knows the difference 
            between a server and the client. I've always known I can build an entire system on my own but I just had to do it in the industry
            which I did.

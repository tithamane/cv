        Summary

        %p.summary__paragraph
          I've been working for 6 months but I actually bring 6 years worth of web knowledge to bring to the table which is something I have to take into consideration on my next offer. 
        
        %p.summary__paragraph
          I add just as much if not more value than people
          have been in the industry for that long. I say this based on the solutions I have seen most developers come up with. The systems I try to
          build in my spare time for for my future company are meant to be

            %li.summary__list_item
              cost effective
            %li.summary__list_item
              easy to maintain
            %li.summary__list_item
              easy to pass on to other developers with little explanation
            %li.summary__list_item
              scalable if ever needed
            %li.summary__list_item
              effiencient enought to boost user experience
          I would also like to see myself reach the highest levels a within the next five to ten years and would be happy to discuss the levels I have reached so far.

            (Different programmer levels)

        %p.summary__paragraph
          Passionate about web development and spent the last 6 years learning as much as I can. I like to watch conference videos posted by the likes of Google, AirBnB, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and many software engineering companies. I also like to read their articles and the challenges they face and how they solve them. I am reading a few books on how to write cleaner maintanable code which has nothing to do with syntax.

        %p.summary__paragraph
          I like solving backend problems using Ruby, PHP and Nodejs but don't really care too much about what I use. Being into ruby, it's only natural that I use Mac, Tmux, Vim and Linux for deployment. I know how to automate things using both Ruby and Nodejs and know my way around Gulp and Webpack. I am an introvert but that changes when talking about web development in general.

          I feel I was under-utilized and didn't get the chance I would have liked. In short I am glad to have moved on and looking back
          I doubt I would have learned much in the long run if I had continued to do the most basic things.

        -# .work__opinion
        -#   They trusted me and I showed them what I can do. As far as things go, I feel I shattered their gantt charts and increased productivity.
        -#   Being here allowed me to see that I am called a "junior" yet I am doing this that even intermediates struggle to get done. I got a chance to 
        -#   compare myself with other developers from different companies and I realised that I am way ahead of what my title makes me.
        .work__opinion
          It is still a work in progress but I have been trusted enough to write code for things that are out of the scope of a junior.
          I make this assumption based on junior developer tests I've seen which basically test if the person knows the difference 
          between a server and the client. I've always known I can build an entire system on my own but I just had to do it in the industry
          which I did.

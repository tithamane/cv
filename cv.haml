          Now open to part time freelancing jobs. Will use my after hours time for this as I am still planning what
          kind of SAAS service I am going to build.

          I <strong>NOT</strong> looking for work at a digital agency as I have realised its a waste both in terms of 
          pay and the amount of stuff you can learn as a developer. I want to be where software/web
          applications are core to the business. Specifically web/cloud applications and big data has
          sparked my interests as something to look into using the google cloud platform.

          My future company should either be using Vuejs or React for the frontend. I have started to put more focus
          on javascript for almost everything. I no longer just want to be the programmer who does 80% new work and
          20% maintaince. 20% need to now be corporate things as I don't intend to work forever nor be the average
          developer. I am not a web designer who builds website with a contact us form(I can do that). My interests 
          are building web applications that have dashboards in them.

          I have been building a LMS meant to be like Blackboard but more effective and it is meant to be
          use by high schools and primary schools. I feel Blackboard is still stuck in 2005. I have been 
          busy for 6 years now and it keeps changing as there are more tools out there. A partner is 
          currently working on getting it out there.

        %p.summary__paragraph
          I keep testing new technologies because I would like to build systems that are:

            cost effective

            easy to maintain
          %li.summary__list_item
            easy to pass on to other developers with little explanation
          %li.summary__list_item
            scalable if ever needed
          %li.summary__list_item
            efficient enought to boost user experience

        %p.summary__paragraph
          I would also like to see myself reach the highest levels a within the next five to ten years and would be happy to discuss the levels I have reached so far.

        Passion For Web
      .section__content
        %p.summary__paragraph
          Passionate about web development and spent the last 6 years learning as much as I can. I like to watch conference videos posted by the likes of Google, AirBnB, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and many software engineering companies. I also like to read their articles and the challenges they face and how they solve them. I am reading a few books on how to write cleaner maintanable code which has nothing to do with syntax.

        %p.summary__paragraph
          I like solving backend problems using Ruby, PHP and Nodejs but don't really care too much about what I use. Being into ruby, it's only natural that I use Mac, Tmux, NeoVim and Linux for deployment. I know how to automate things using both Ruby and Nodejs and know my way around Gulp and Webpack. I am an introvert but that changes when talking about web development in general.
